# Sign-Language-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning

In this project I had a dataset of images with 38 different classes
Data was read using OpenCv and visualized using matplot lib
To solve this classification problem i used deep learning
According to the problem CNN's was the best neural networks to solve this problem
Multiple layers of CNN and subsampling was added to enhance the perfornmance of model
Model was trained with 88% accuracy and f1-score
